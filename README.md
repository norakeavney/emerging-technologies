## Problem 1: Generating Random Boolean Functions

This problem creates randomly generated Boolean functions that are either **constant** or **balanced**. These functions take four Boolean inputs and return a single Boolean output.

- A **constant function** returns the same value (either True or False) for all possible input combinations.
- A **balanced function** returns True for exactly half of the inputs and False for the other half.

These functions serve as the foundation for testing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which can determine whether a function is constant or balanced with a single quantum evaluation, compared to multiple classical evaluations.

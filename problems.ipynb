    "### Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem creates example Boolean functions that will be used in later parts of the assignment.\n",
    "The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm assumes that a function is either constant or balanced, and its goal is to determine which type it is without knowing how the function works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1 provides these functions in a classical form so they can be tested and analysed in both classical and quantum settings later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boolean function is a function that maps Boolean inputs to a Boolean output.\n",
    "In this problem, each function takes **four Boolean inputs**, meaning there are *$2^4 = 16$* possible input combinations.\n",
    "The function returns a single Boolean value (`True` or `False`) for each of these combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to randomly generate functions that are *guaranteed* to be either constant or balanced.\n",
    "This mirrors the oracle model used in quantum computing, where the internal behaviour of the function is hidden and only its outputs can be observed through evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constant function**  \n",
    "A Boolean function is constant if it returns the same output for every possible input.\n",
    "For four input bits, this means the function returns either:\n",
    "- `False` for all 16 input combinations, or\n",
    "- `True` for all 16 input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced function**  \n",
    "A Boolean function is balanced if it returns `True` for exactly half of all possible inputs and `False` for the other half.\n",
    "With four input bits, this corresponds to:\n",
    "- 8 inputs returning `True`\n",
    "- 8 inputs returning `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simply Said\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, this problem creates a hidden Boolean function that:\n",
    "- takes four `True`/`False` inputs,\n",
    "- returns a single `True` or `False`,\n",
    "- and is guaranteed to be either:\n",
    "  - always the same (constant), or\n",
    "  - evenly split between `True` and `False` (balanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function type is chosen randomly, and the caller is not told which type was selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance to Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction between constant and balanced functions is fundamental to the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "Classically, determining whether an unknown Boolean function is constant or balanced may require testing the function on many different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm can determine this global property with a **single evaluation** of the function when implemented as a quantum oracle. In simple terms, quantum computing cares more about the pattern than the inputs.  It can ask the question like *“Are the outputs the same, or do they cancel each other out?”* instead of looping through different inputs to evaluate the outputs.\n",
    "Problem 1 establishes the classical foundation required to understand this quantum advantage by providing valid functions that satisfy the algorithm’s promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing these functions explicitly, we will later compare classical and quantum approaches to solving the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Example Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows the difference between constant and balanced Boolean functions using a small sample of input combinations.\n",
    "Each input consists of four Boolean values, and the output is a single Boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input (x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄) | Constant Function Output | Balanced Function Output |\n",
    "|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| (False, False, False, False) | True  | False |\n",
    "| (False, False, False, True)  | True  | True  |\n",
    "| (False, False, True, False)  | True  | False |\n",
    "| (False, True, False, False)  | True  | True  |\n",
    "| (True, False, False, False)  | True  | False |\n",
    "| (True, True, False, False)   | True  | True  |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constant case, the output is the same for every input.\n",
    "In the balanced case, the outputs are split evenly between `True` and `False` across all possible inputs (only a subset is shown here).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach would have been to construct balanced functions using specific logical expressions (e.g., XOR combinations of inputs). While this can produce balanced behaviour, it does not automatically guarantee that exactly half of all 16 inputs return `True` without additional validation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility would be to generate outputs randomly at each function call. However, this would violate the deterministic “oracle” assumption required by the Deutsch–Jozsa problem, where the function must have fixed behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, a precomputed truth-table approach was selected. This guarantees correctness, and aligns cleanly with the mathematical definition of a Boolean function.\n",

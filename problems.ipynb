    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boolean function is a function that maps Boolean inputs to a Boolean output.\n",
    "In this problem, each function takes **four Boolean inputs**, meaning there are *$2^4 = 16$* possible input combinations.\n",
    "The function returns a single Boolean value (`True` or `False`) for each of these combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to randomly generate functions that are *guaranteed* to be either constant or balanced.\n",
    "This mirrors the oracle model used in quantum computing, where the internal behaviour of the function is hidden and only its outputs can be observed through evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constant function**  \n",
    "A Boolean function is constant if it returns the same output for every possible input.\n",
    "For four input bits, this means the function returns either:\n",
    "- `False` for all 16 input combinations, or\n",
    "- `True` for all 16 input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced function**  \n",
    "A Boolean function is balanced if it returns `True` for exactly half of all possible inputs and `False` for the other half.\n",
    "With four input bits, this corresponds to:\n",
    "- 8 inputs returning `True`\n",
    "- 8 inputs returning `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simply Stated\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, this problem creates a “black box” Boolean function that:\n",
    "- takes four `True`/`False` inputs,\n",
    "- returns a single `True` or `False`,\n",
    "- and is guaranteed to be either:\n",
    "  - always the same (constant), or\n",
    "  - evenly split between `True` and `False` (balanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function type is chosen randomly, and the caller is not told which type was selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance to Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction between constant and balanced functions is fundamental to the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "Classically, determining whether an unknown Boolean function is constant or balanced may require evaluating the function on many different inputs in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm can determine this global property with a **single evaluation** of the function when implemented as a quantum oracle.\n",
    "Problem 1 establishes the classical foundation required to understand this quantum advantage by providing valid functions that satisfy the algorithm’s promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing these functions explicitly, we can later compare classical and quantum approaches to solving the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "For a constant function, evaluating the function on any of the 16 possible input combinations will always produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a balanced function, evaluating the function across all input combinations will result in exactly half of the outputs being `True` and half being `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation below generates such a function at random and returns it as a callable Python function, allowing it to be treated as an unknown oracle in later problems.\n",
